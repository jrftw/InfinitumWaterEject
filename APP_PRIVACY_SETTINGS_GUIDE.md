# App Privacy Settings Guide

## Issue Fixed: NSUserTrackingUsageDescription Removed

âœ… **RESOLVED**: Removed `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` from Info.plist
- Your app no longer requests tracking permission
- No need to update App Privacy settings for tracking
- App Store submission should now proceed without tracking warnings

## Current AdMob Configuration

Your app uses AdMob for advertisements but does NOT request tracking permission:

### âœ… What's Configured:
- **GADApplicationIdentifier**: `ca-app-pub-6815311336585204~5510127729`
- **SKAdNetworkItems**: Configured for iOS 14+ attribution
- **No Tracking Permission**: App doesn't request `ATTrackingManager` authorization

### ðŸ“± App Privacy Settings (App Store Connect)

Since you're NOT requesting tracking permission, you should set:

**Data Collection:**
- **No Data Collection for Tracking**: âœ… (Correct)
- **No Third-Party Analytics**: âœ… (Correct)
- **No User Tracking**: âœ… (Correct)

**AdMob Integration:**
- **Advertisements**: âœ… (Yes - you show ads)
- **Ad Performance**: âœ… (Yes - for ad attribution)
- **No User Tracking**: âœ… (Correct - you don't track users)

## What This Means

1. **No Tracking Permission Dialog**: Users won't see the tracking permission popup
2. **Simpler Privacy**: Your app has minimal privacy requirements
3. **AdMob Still Works**: You can still show ads without tracking permission
4. **App Store Approval**: Should proceed without tracking-related issues

## Next Steps

1. **Build and Test**: Create a new build with the updated Info.plist
2. **Upload to App Store**: Submit the new build
3. **App Privacy**: In App Store Connect, ensure tracking is set to "No"
4. **Review**: The tracking warning should no longer appear

## Verification

After uploading the new build, you should see:
- âœ… No tracking permission warnings
- âœ… App Privacy section shows "No Data Collection for Tracking"
- âœ… AdMob ads still display correctly
- âœ… App Store review proceeds normally

**Status**: âœ… **FIXED** - Ready for App Store submission without tracking issues
