## Setup Instructions

### For Xcode Project Configuration

#### 1. Add Apple Watch App Target
1. In Xcode, go to **File → New → Target**
2. Choose **Watch App** under watchOS
3. Name it **"WaterEjectWatchApp"**
4. Ensure **"Include Notification Scene"** is unchecked
5. Click **Finish**

#### 2. Configure App Groups
1. Select your project in Xcode
2. Go to **Signing & Capabilities**
3. Click **+ Capability** and add **App Groups**
4. Add the group: `group.com.infinitumimagery.watereject`
5. Enable this group for:
   - Main app target
   - Widget extension target
   - Apple Watch app target

#### 3. Copy Watch App Files
1. Copy `WatchApp/WaterEjectWatchApp.swift` to the Watch App target
2. Copy `WatchApp/WaterEjectComplication.swift` to the Watch App target
3. Copy `WatchApp/Info.plist` to the Watch App target
4. Copy `WatchApp/WaterEjectWatchApp.entitlements` to the Watch App target

#### 4. Configure Widget Extension
1. Ensure the widget extension target has the App Groups capability
2. Copy `WaterEjectWidgetExtension/WaterEjectWidgetExtension.entitlements` to the widget target
3. Verify the widget extension Info.plist is properly configured

#### 5. Build and Test
1. Clean build folder (**Cmd+Shift+K**)
2. Build project (**Cmd+B**)
3. Test on device with Apple Watch
4. Test widget functionality
5. Verify data synchronization

### For Production Deployment

#### 1. Version Synchronization
- Ensure all targets have the same version and build numbers
- Use the provided `sync_versions.sh` script if needed

#### 2. App Store Configuration
