echo "=================================="
echo ""
echo "1. Open 'Infinitum Water Eject.xcodeproj' in Xcode"
echo ""
echo "2. In the Project Navigator, select the project root"
echo ""
echo "3. In the TARGETS section, find and DELETE these targets:"
echo "   ‚ùå WaterEjectWatchApp"
echo "   ‚ùå WaterEjectWatchApp Watch App" 
echo "   ‚ùå WaterEjectWidgetExtension (if you don't want widgets either)"

echo "   - Right-click on the target"
echo "   - Select 'Delete'"
echo "   - Choose 'Move to Trash' (not just 'Remove Reference')"

echo "5. In the PROJECT section, remove any watch-related:"
echo "   - Build phases that reference watch targets"
echo "   - Dependencies on watch targets"
echo "   - Embed Watch Content phases"
echo ""
echo "6. Clean and rebuild the main app target"
echo ""
echo "7. Verify in Xcode that only the main iOS app target remains"
echo ""
echo "8. Test build to ensure no watch assets are included"
echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT NOTES:"
echo "   - This will permanently remove watch targets from the project"
echo "   - Watch app files will remain in the file system but won't be built"
echo "   - You can re-add watch targets later if needed"
echo "   - Make sure you want to completely remove watch functionality"
echo ""
echo "‚úÖ Script completed. Follow the manual steps above."
echo ""
echo "üîç After removal, verify by:"
echo "   - Building the project"
echo "   - Checking that no watch assets appear in build output"
echo "   - Confirming App Store submission doesn't include watch targets"
